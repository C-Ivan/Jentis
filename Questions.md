**1. What additional documentation or information would have made planning the tests for this app more efficient?**

- Acceptance Criteria: To understand the expected scope of the testing and ensure all functional requirements are met.
- API Specifications: Detailed API documentation (e.g., Swagger) to fully understand the endpoints, request/response structures, and field validations (e.g., max length, accepted values). This helps in planning both functional and validation tests effectively.
- Database Schema and Access Information: Information about the database schema, data relationships, and access methods to verify data integrity and perform data validation checks.
- Expected Performance Metrics: Specific performance benchmarks and thresholds to conduct performance and load testing, ensuring the application meets the required performance standards.
- UX/UI Design Specifications: Detailed UX/UI design guidelines and prototypes to validate the visual and functional aspects of the user interface against the expected design.

**2. Identify the components of the app that can be tested. Is there a hierarchy of importance in these components?**

*If by components we understand API, GUI, DB:*

1) API: The API is of higher importance since it handles all backend operations, data processing, and business logic.
2) Database: The database is essential for data storage, retrieval, and integrity, supporting both the API and GUI.
3) GUI: The GUI is also critical as it is the main interface for user interactions with the system.

*If by components we understand functionalities:*

We can test all the endpoints of the provided API, both by API calls and through GUI interactions, and we can test the frontend part.

In this case, the order of importance would be:

1) Core Functionalities: Ensuring that the primary business logic and workflows (happy paths) are executed correctly through both backend (API) and frontend (GUI).
2) User Interactions and Edge Cases: Testing negative cases, error handling, and unusual user interactions to ensure robustness and a good user experience.
3) Performance: Validating the app's performance under various conditions to ensure it meets expected standards.
4) Visual Components: Checking the design and visual aspects to ensure they meet the specified UX/UI guidelines.

Of course, even when we prioritize components, we need to understand that a holistic approach should be used when testing because even if the core functionalities are working but we take 10 seconds to execute a request, it won't be acceptable.

**3. For each identified area, how would you approach testing?**

For both the API and GUI tests, I would use Playwright since I can use the same framework to handle both kinds of tests, making it easier to maintain.

I would check the provided documentation to understand the scope of the testing to be performed and would create the necessary test cases, usually containing happy path, validation tests, negative cases, e2e, etc.

Once I have the test cases created, I would separate and tag (or label) test cases that can be automated and the ones that need to be executed manually.

I would then execute manual test cases and develop the automated ones and execute them as well.

Assuming we have a smoke and regression test plan, I would add the pertinent test cases to each test plan for subsequent executions (if there's no smoke and/or regression in place, I would highly recommend creating it).
